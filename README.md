## About

This is the final project for CPRG-211D (OOP II). It is a prototype student administration system that allows administrators to add students and manage their information. 
These students can then be registered for certain courses and their course offerings can be searched. The roster of students in a certain course can also be retrieved with search. 

## Technologies

This is an app built with .NET MAUI for the user interface, C# for processing, and a mySQL Database (MariaDB) for data storage.
